First: read [info.md](docs/info.md)

To get started with development, run the command `npm build && npm dev` to start up a development server.

Alternatively, run the command `npm watch` in one terminal, and `npm dev` in another terminal to start a development server.

To use fish-commands with a server installed somewhere else, run `npm attach [jarfilepath.jar]`

Once you have made and tested your changes, submit a PR.
