# Fish commands

A plugin that adds commands to the server.

If you stumbled upon this repo, I'm sorry.

This started as just a couple simple commands I wanted on my server, and I did not have scalability in mind. I am in the process of re-writing this in case anyone has the unfortune of adding to this or trying to understand it.

TODO:
[] Update the repo to latest
[] Break functions and different events into folders and components
[] Add comments to explain everything.
